        <h2>Survey and Installation</h2>
        
        <p>
        Following acceptance of a quote and appointment is arranged to meet at your park.

        I personally come out to meet all of my customers bringing a "sample" window along with a catalogue of before and after photographs from previous projects.  During this meeting we can discuss window openings, opaque glass options and doors/bathrooms along with a complete measuring survey to allow  your custom windows and doors to be manufactured all before arranging and agreeing upon a convenient fit date for installation!
        </p>
        <p>
        On the agreed installation date, we typically start work at 8:00am and the whole installation is completed on that day.  All fixings, trims and easy release door catches are provided.  During the installation we put dust sheets down, and clean up inside and out before taking any old windows, doors and rubbish away from site.

        We do not employee teams of fitters, I personally do all my own fits in order to guarentee our high standards and quality of work.
        </p>
        <p>
        I take great pride in my work, I'm professional and totally reliable.  I leave customers totally satisfied and the vast majority of my work comes from recommendations!  Why not take a look at what others have said in the <a href="/info/feedback.html">feekback section</a>.
