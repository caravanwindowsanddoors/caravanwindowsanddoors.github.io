        <h2>Survey and Installation</h2>
        
        <p>
        Following acceptance of a quote an appointment is arranged to meet at your park.

        I personally come out to meet all my customers. I bring a “Sample” window, and a catalogue of photographs showing before and after completed projects. I discuss window openings, opaque glass options for doors and bathrooms, and complete a survey before arranging a Fit date convenient to yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
        On the agreed Installation date, we start work at 8.00 am and the Installation will be completed on that day. All fixings, trims and new, easy release door catches are provided. We put dust sheets down, and clean up inside and out - we remove old windows and doors and any rubbish, from site.
        </p>
        <p>
        We do not employee teams of fitters, I personally do all my own fits in order to guarentee our high standards and quality of work.
        </p>
        <p>
        I take great pride in my work, I'm professional and totally reliable.  I leave customers totally satisfied and the vast majority of my work comes from recommendations!  Why not take a look at what others have said in the <a href="/info/feedback.html">feekback section</a>.
