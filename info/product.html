        I personally come out to meet all of my cusomters.

        Your new windows and doors are “tailor made” to fit your van. Each job is broken down into two parts, first I complete a full survey, measuring all the openings. Next, when fitting your windows and doors they are individually balanced to your van (vital to ensure a good fit).  This ensures a perfect fit and air tight seal.

        Our “Slimline” window system, fits caravan walls 38mm thick, the windows and doors wrap around the openings by 20mm. This 20mm wrap around has a 6mm thick <strong>rubber foam tape</strong> attached, this 20mm on the window wraps around the outside wall. It is then fitted into place with an aluminium “T” bar, that locks into the specially designed window frame giving a secure clamp finish.  It fits flush with the Inside wall and the T bar acts as a neat internal trim! On the outside it crushes the tape (its Neoprene, that’s what wet suits are made of) to make a water tight draft proof tidy seal... we do not use messy and unsightly silicon sealants’!

        The window frame holds a 24mm double glazed glass unit comprised of 2 pieces of 4mm glass with a 16mm air gap.

        Doors are fitted with thumb key/quick release locks on the inside to comply with fire regulations, they are key locked from outside, with three keys provided, per lock. The doors are full speck house doors fitted with high security 5 lever locks and 28mm toughened safety glass in a choice of patterns.
