        I personally come out to meet all of my cusomters to carry out a site survey.

        In order to ensure you get the best possible fit your windows and doors are tailor made for your van. During our survey your van is professionally measured prior to manufacture and then the customer windows are balanced during fitting to give you the best possible result.

        We remove and clean off all old sealant or putty from around the existing windows and doors to bring your van back to its original finish on the external cladding, before installing the new windows and doors.

        Our "Slimline" window system fits caravan walls 38mm thick.  The windows and doors wrap around the opening by 20mm. This 20mm wrap around has a 6mm thick rubber foam tape attached.  The windows are then inserted and made flush with the inside of your van wall.  An aluminium "T" bar is then installed to lock the window into the specially designed frame. This gives a secure clamp finish allowing the "T" bar to act as a neat internal trim. On the outside of the van, the window the tape (its Neoprene, that's what wet suits are made of!) forms a water tight draft proof seal... we do not use any messy, unsightly silicon sealants!

        The window frame holds a 24mm double glazed glass unit comprised of 2 pieces of 4mm glass with a 16mm air gap.

        The doors are full speck house doors fitted with high security 5 lever locks and 28mm toughened safety glass in a choice of patterns.
