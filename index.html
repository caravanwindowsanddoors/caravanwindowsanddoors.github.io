                        </header>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Site Survey - an appointment is arranged for us to meet. I will bring a sample window and a catalogue of photographs of before and after completed projects. Then we will discuss style / design and recommend the best practice window in regards to opening / designs, i.e fire escape windows and offer a selection of opaque options for bathrooms etc...
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Installation - takes one day (two people) all mastics, fixings, trim and new easy release door catches are provided. We put down dust sheets and upon completion we clean your new windows and doors inside and out and then vacuum the entire van. We remove your old windows and doors from site.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        After Sales Service - Looking after our customers is very important to us. We return to every service call, we never dissappoint. This is why 75% of our work comes from Recommendations. We are proud to guarantee our Products and workmanship. Please call us on <strong>07922 123 091</strong> for a quotation.

                            <p>
                            Our Slim-Line Windows have reduced sight lines and a back to front depth of 48mm. Perfect for narrower wall construction.
                            <br /><br />
                            The slim-line odd leg section sits on the external face of the building, giving a coverage of 19mm on all sides. A 6mm foam tape can be installed on the window, which when compressed during installation stage, becomes watertight and fills in any gaps within the external cladding giving a clean finish.
                            <br /><br />
                            The windows are installed by knocking an aluminium fixing bar into the specially designed window, giving a secure clamp fix finish. The fixing bar then doubles up as an internal trim which sits flush to the inner wall. This is suitable for wall construction of 38mm or 53mm. If your wall construction differs, then we can fix them using screws and trim up on the inside.
                            <br /><br />
                            The Slim-line windows hold a 24mm double glazed unit, whilst the door accomodates a 28mm double glazed unit / panel.
